Hello there! I am Dimos, a technology *(and fitness)* geek at heart, born in Greece and living in London. This is my personal blog, which I called "A curious mind", because I have been a curious mind ever since I remember myself. Whenever I have some free time and I have something to write about, this is where it goes. You can find a list of all by previous posts [here](/blog). On the rare occasion that you find any of them interesting, you can track any upcoming ones via [this feed](/feed.xml). As a general principle, I tend to keep my blog posts immutable in order to preserve thoughts in their original form, but occasionally I might discover something that might make me change my mind or enlighten me more about the topic in question. In these cases, I prefer appending an "update" entry at the end of the blog post with a corresponding date. Hopefully, this helps you get a well-rounded perspective on the topic, while also helping me to track the evolution of my thoughts, which I find to be an interesting activity. 

I've also published a course about the microservices architecture, which you can follow [here](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/microservices-architecture-video) and I have written a book about distributed systems for practitioners with the ultimate goal of making concepts around distributed systems easier to understand and reason about. You can find the book's website [here](https://distsysbook.co.uk) and a blog post with some more information about it [here](/distributed-systems-for-practitioners). Outside the software world, I enjoy immensely playing football and futsal, travelling around the world and experiencing other cultures.

If you want to reach out, you can find me at [raptis.dimos@yahoo.gr](mailto:raptis.dimos@yahoo.gr).
