Hi, I am Dimos, a tech (and fitness) geek at heart, who's getting used to being called 'Software Engineer'.

One of the many things I like are lists. So, here's a handy list of things that I am passionate about:
* **clean**, nicely written (and, most important, easily read) **code**
* **learning** (and hopefully also teaching) new things from/to other people
* **contributing** to the awesome open-source community out there
* **distributed systems**
* various **software engineering methodologies**, mainly: [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), [FP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), ...

In order to avoid sounding boring as hell, here's one more list with non-software things I like doing:
* playing **football** and (more frequently) **futsal**. Don't ask me what that is, [go find yourself..](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=futsal)
* watching **movies**, preferably while eating pizza
* **travelling** and seeing new things

If you share any of the interests above or you just want to let me know how ugly my website is, you can ping me at [raptis.dimos@yahoo.gr](mailto:raptis.dimos@yahoo.gr).

Cheerio,

Dimos
