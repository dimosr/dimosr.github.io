{: .image-pull-right}

I am a technology *(and fitness)* geek at heart, born in Greece and living in London. I am currently working as a Software Engineer for R3, building the next-generation distributed ledger platform, **Corda** (if you haven't heard about it, you [**should check it out**](https://www.corda.net/)). Before that, I was working in Amazon for Alexa and Amazon Video. I have a big passion for clean code, distributed systems and various software engineering disciplines (see [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), [FP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)), but this list keeps growing alarmingly. 

I've also authored a course about the microservices architecture, which you can follow [here](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/microservices-architecture-video). Currently, I am also in the process of writing a book about distributed systems with the ultimate goal of making concepts around distributed systems easier to understand and reason about. You can find it [here](https://leanpub.com/distributed-systems-for-practitioners). In general, I like sharing knowledge and exchanging ideas, whether it is in a meetup, conference or a local pub. When I find some free time and I have something to rant about, I am also blogging and you can find some of my posts here. On the rare occasion that you find any of them interesting, you can track any upcoming ones via [this feed](/feed.xml) .Outside the software world, I enjoy immensely playing football and futsal, travelling around the world and experiencing other cultures.

If you want to reach out, you can find me at [raptis.dimos@yahoo.gr](mailto:raptis.dimos@yahoo.gr).
