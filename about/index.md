{: .image-pull-right}

I am a technology *(and fitness)* geek at heart, born in Greece and living in London. I am currently working as a Software Engineer for R3, building the next-generation distributed ledger platform, **Corda** (if you haven't heard about it, you [**should check it out**](https://www.corda.net/)). Before that, I was working at Amazon for Alexa and Amazon Video. I have a big passion for clean code, distributed systems, software architecture and various other software engineering disciplines (e.g. see [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), [FP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)), but this list keeps growing alarmingly. 

I've published a course about the microservices architecture, which you can follow [here](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/microservices-architecture-video). I have also authored a book about distributed systems for practitioners with the ultimate goal of making concepts around distributed systems easier to understand and reason about. You can find the book [here](https://leanpub.com/distributed-systems-for-practitioners) and a blog post with some more information about it [here](/distributed-systems-for-practitioners). When I find some free time and I have something to rant about, I am also blogging and you can find some of my posts [here](/blog). On the rare occasion that you find any of them interesting, you can track any upcoming ones via [this feed](/feed.xml) .Outside the software world, I enjoy immensely playing football and futsal, travelling around the world and experiencing other cultures.
