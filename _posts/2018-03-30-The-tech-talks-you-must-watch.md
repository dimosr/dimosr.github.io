This post is part of the ["Things you MUST do (if you haven't yet)" series]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-25-The-things-you-must-do %}), covering tech talks. If you want to read a bit more of my rumbling on why I started doing this, feel free to read the original post, linked above.

Below, you will find a personal compilation of the best tech talks I've watched so far and I'd recommend to anyone looking to expand his field of knowledge. Note that I've put effort in excluding mediocre videos from this list to make sure this list can be as valuable as possible. The main criteria I've used are the following:
* the ideas presented on the talks are timeless.
* the knowledge is as generic and technology-unaware as possible, so that people from all technical fields and backgrounds can benefit.
* the talks contained breakthrough ideas or made me see things from a new perspective. Of course, this can't be done without bias, since the more talks I watch, the harder it is for a new talk to satisfy this check.
* Last but not least (and this is a hard one!), ideally it should be a talk I'd be willing to invest some time in watching again. 

Enough chit-chat, time for some action. Oh, and one last thing, this post is clearly a work in progress, so feel free to bookmark it and come back for more talks!

### [Deliberate Practice in Software Development](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/poppendieck-deliberate-practice-in-software-development)

_Have you ever heard of the 10-year rule ? Yes, this theory that a person must persevere with learning and practising a craft or discipline for about 10 years before he or she can make a breakthrough. In this talk, Mary Poppendieck makes an interesting analysis on that theory, talking about the process of deliberate practice and making a deep dive on what one can do to improve on his/her craft. She's focusing mainly on the field of software development, but many of the ideas are also applicable in other fields._

### [Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)

_In this talk, Rich Hickey, the creator of the Clojure language, analyses the difference between simple and easy. He explains why easy solutions might give you the false impression of moving faster, but simplicity is what will help you move fast in the long term. He peppers his arguments with a generous dose of humor, irony and perhaps subjectivity, but this talk contains so much insight around the process of software development and software evolution, so I'd highly recommend it._

### [SOLID in the Wild: Life When Your Software is Actually Soft](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/solid-case-study)

_If you are a software engineer, I bet you've already heard and read a lot about the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)). The reason I included this video in this list is because it's one the of few videos that provide a pragmatic view of the principles. 3 engineers from Pivotal talk about one of their past projects, where they set out to build an online marketplace, giving concrete examples of where and how they used the principles and how they benefited from them._

### [Developing Expertise: Herding Racehorses, Racing Sheep](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Developing-Expertise-Dave-Thomas)

In this one, Dave Thomas, the author of the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org), expands on [the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition), describing the various levels of competency, how one can transition between them and how you should treat people differently according to their level. He concludes by explaining how the model can be used to improve how companies operate and how individuals can shape their career trajectories.

### [A Brief, Opinionated History of the API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzMp6uQbmns)

In this talk, Joshua Bloch - one of the minds behind Java - walks you through the history of APIs, also reflecting on the current legal status, specifically around the legal case between Google and Oracle. This is a great talk for software engineers that are curious and would like to get a glimpse of how it all started and how the concepts of a function or a library were invented. It's all presented in a very insightful way. It also provides food for thought around what constitutes and API and what could the repercussions be if APIs were copyrighted.
