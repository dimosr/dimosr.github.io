A Kung Fu student asks his teacher: 

- _"Master, why does my ability not improve? I'm always defeated."_

And the master, pensive and forever patient, answersâ€¦

- _"My dear pupil, have you seen the gulls flying by the setting sun and their wings seeming like flames?"_

- _"Yes, my master, I have."_

- _"And a waterfall, spilling mightly over the stones without taking anything out of its proper place?"_

- _"Yes, my master, I have witnessed it."_

- _"And the moon, when it touches the calm water to reflect all its enormous beauty?"_

- _"Yes, my master, I have also seen this marvelous phenomenon."_

- _"That is the problem. You keep watching all this shit instead of training."_
