As a person, I am curious by nature. As a result, I've always been looking for new things to do, learn etc. Many times, this exploration process comes with a significant overhead, such as subscribing to mailing lists, social media pages etc. Furthermore, this process seems to be following the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), which means that only a small percentage of the content discovered is gonna be really valuable, so there's a lot of time wasted to find that content. I wish I could find someone that had been through this before me, so that he could point me straight to the best of it.

For this reason, I decided to start a series of posts, where I'll be sharing a curated list of things that I'd highly recommend to anyone. By using the word "things", I am being quite generic on purpose, because I can't know in advance all the areas that I will be touching. I am not going to lie, this curiosity manifests more evidently in the professional aspect of my life. So, the first posts will probably be around technical subjects, such as tech talks or books, but who knows where that could end...

Below, you can find a list of the posts that will be part of this series. I'll be constantly adding new things in my compilation as I discover them, so feel free to re-visit the posts periodically for new content. Last but not least, I tried to include only high-value content in this list, but that can't be fully objective, so take everything with a grain (or two) of salt.
