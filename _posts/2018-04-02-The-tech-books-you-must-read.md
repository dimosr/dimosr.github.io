This post is part of the ["Things you MUST do (if you haven't yet)" series]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-25-The-things-you-must-do %}), covering books about technology and software. If you want to read a bit more of my rumbling on why I started doing this, feel free to read the original post, linked above.

This post contains some of the best tech books I've read so far. Every suggestion comes with a brief summary of what I gained from each book and why I think it's worth investing the time to read it. Similar to all the posts belonging in this series, keep in mind this is a (constant) work-in-progress, so entries might be added without further notice.

### [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/)

_As you can confirm by the reviews of the book, this is definitely a must-read for any professional who is involved in the design of large-scale systems. That said, this book is not an easy read, it's quite big and touches a lot of concepts. The author has selected a bottom-up approach, starting from a rather interesting analysis of the low-level parts of storage engines and then moving on to how these can be composed to build bigger systems, like the ones commonly used today (such as Cassandra, ElasticSearch etc.). Along the way, there's an ongoing, background analysis on trade-offs behing design decisions. The author manages to provide a nice explanation of almost all the basic building blocks of distributed algorithms, such as sharding, replication, consensus, transactions etc. However, he would not be able to go into full detail in a single book, so you will need to spend time on your own, studying each part. Fortunately, the author provides very useful resources and references to start with._

### [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215)

_This is one of the few books that have shaped the way I develop and think about software. It's a quite old book, written in 2003, but it's still very applicable to the way software is developed nowadays. Eric Evans is the pioneer of the term Domain-Driven Design, which has ended up being quite a fad lately. As a result, there are much more recent books. However, I think that this book also provides insight into the early days of software development, which is extremely valuable and interesting. The language of the book can get quite abstract at times, the writing style is not the best and it has received a lot of criticism on that. Still, if you want to become an expert in data and domain modelling, this is the place to start from. Plus, you will be able to boast having read the whole "blue" book (for those who know)!_
